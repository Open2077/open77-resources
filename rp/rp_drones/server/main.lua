-- rp_drones -- server half, and the whole resource: there is no client code.
--
-- ONE CLOCK, ONE AUTHORITY. Every drone is a server-owned entity and every
-- position it ever holds is written by this file. A client is told where the
-- swarm is; it never decides. That is what makes two players standing side by
-- side watch the same 77 at the same instant, and it is not a stylistic
-- preference: the obvious shortcut -- hand each client the formation list and
-- let it walk its own timers -- drifts within the first morph, because each
-- client's clock is its own.
--
-- THREE MEASURED FACTS SHAPE EVERY DECISION BELOW. All three were read out of
-- the platform's own source rather than guessed, and the README cites them.
--
--   1. THE LINK IS 256 KB/s AND IT DISCONNECTS, IT DOES NOT DEGRADE.
--      GameNetworkingSockets clamps every connection's send rate there and
--      the transport turns the resulting LimitExceeded into a DISCONNECT once
--      512 KB has queued. The first build of this resource sent 415 KB/s of
--      drone traffic and dropped the player it was performing for, eight
--      seconds into the opening morph. Hence `budgetedRate`: the update rate
--      is DERIVED from a byte budget and a show that will not fit is refused
--      before a single drone is spawned.
--
--   2. EVERY UPDATE IS A WHOLE RECORD, TO EVERY VIEWER, IMMEDIATELY. The
--      server does not coalesce, does not diff, and does not skip a write
--      that changed nothing -- 490 bytes to move a point one step. Hence
--      `clock.moveEpsilon` and `snap`: this file does the skipping and the
--      rounding itself, which is why holding a formation costs nothing.
--
--   3. THERE IS NO CLIENT-SIDE INTERPOLATION. A projected prop's position is
--      written with entIPlacedComponent::SetLocalPosition -- a hard jump. So
--      the update rate IS the swarm's frame rate, and since the rate is set
--      by the budget, the SPEED is what has to give: `clock.maxStepMetres`
--      fixes how far a drone may jump and every morph is stretched to obey it.
--
--   4. A LIGHT IS NOT A DRONE. A `kind = "light"` prop is culled by the
--      renderer past 50 m -- its host inherits a loot crate's authored
--      `autoHideDistance` -- and a point light in empty air illuminates
--      nothing and draws no pixels of its own. Both were confirmed only after
--      flying a whole invisible show. The default style is now the VFX, and
--      `farthestDrone` refuses a light show that would be culled.
--
--   5. A LIGHT'S COLOUR CANNOT BE ANIMATED. Writing colour or intensity
--      disables the light component for one frame before re-enabling it, so a
--      per-tick colour blend strobes. Colour therefore changes only on
--      arrival at a pose, where the blink reads as a flash.

--- The plane the picture is drawn on.
---
--- THE PICTURE ALWAYS FACES THE ANCHOR. `facing` chooses which way the show is
--- from the operator; the plane's normal is then taken from the anchor to the
--- stage centre, so the audience never gets the picture edge-on. That is
--- deliberate insurance: if the yaw convention here is a quarter-turn out, the
--- show appears in the wrong compass direction and still reads correctly,
--- instead of becoming an invisible line of lights.
--- The stage a show is drawn on: its own, falling back to the global one field
--- by field.
---
--- A sign is not a ring. `OPEN//77` needs to be wider than it is tall and to
--- hang further back to fit in the frame, and forcing the global stage to suit
--- it would ruin every other show. So a show may carry a `stage` table and
--- override only what it cares about.
--- A RUNTIME OVERRIDE BEATS BOTH, and that is deliberate.
---
--- `stage.standoff = 24` is right for the way a drone show is normally watched
--- -- standing under it, head back, the figure filling the view. It is wrong
--- the moment a CAMERA watches from behind a seated player: the frame no longer
--- follows the eye, and a 22 m figure at 24 m spans about 49 degrees with its
--- top well outside the shot. The owner's words, on the first take: "on voit
--- que la moitie".
---
--- Moving the whole config for one camera setup would be the wrong trade, and
--- so would baking filming geometry into a show. `droneshow stage <standoff>
--- <altitude> <width> <height>` sets it for the session instead, persisted like
--- the style, and `droneshow stage off` gives every show its own geometry back.

-- The vehicle-sweep guard
--
-- THE CANDIDATE CAUSE OF THE BLINK, and a workaround for it that a server
-- owner can switch on and off without editing anything.
--
-- A drone record resolves to an `av_*.ent`, so its spawned body is a
-- `vehicleBaseObject`. Open77 sweeps everything the entity spawner publishes
-- and removes vehicles it cannot find in `EntityService` -- and a server-owned
-- NPC only lands in `EntityService` at the END of its spawn, while the sweep
-- sees it at the START. The sibling sweep, `WorldSanitizer`, closes that window
-- with a second check against the dynamic-entity table and a 500 ms grace;
-- this one has neither. A race, not a cull, which is why it blinks.
--
-- The sweep's vehicle branch is armed whenever ambient traffic is off, which is
-- the default for any bucket nobody has configured. Telling the bucket that
-- traffic is allowed makes the whole branch skip.
--
-- The bucket's existing crowd and police settings are read first and put back
-- afterwards: this resource borrows one field of somebody else's policy and
-- gives it back, rather than stamping its own over the top.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- override if one was set, otherwise the measured default from the config.
--- The budget can still stretch it; this is the floor it starts from.
--- The floor below which a flip-book frame cannot work, whatever anybody types.
---
--- Decomposed from the platform's source, not guessed: one server tick before
--- the create is sent, a client frame to drain it, another for the off-thread
--- stub callback, a HARD 250 ms readiness settle that is not a tick and not
--- tunable, one more server tick for this resource's poll, and two network
--- polls. About 350 ms before the engine has streamed a byte of a vehicle
--- mesh -- and that streaming has no deadline in the code at all.
---
--- Asking for less is not merely useless. A spawn already in flight is NOT
--- cancelled when the next frame despawns it: the engine still streams,
--- instantiates and then destroys the body.

--- THE BUDGET. How fast the swarm may be updated, in Hz per drone, derived
--- from bytes per second and never from a configured rate.
---
--- This function exists because the first build of this resource trusted its
--- config to be sane and disconnected the player it was performing for:
--- GameNetworkingSockets clamps a connection to 256 KB/s and DISCONNECTS once
--- 512 KB has queued behind the clamp. 48 drones at 15 Hz is 369 KB/s of prop
--- traffic alone, so the link had about eight seconds to live. The rate is
--- now an output, not an input.
---
--- Answers the rate, and the reason it is not flyable when it is too low.
--- How long a sequence frame has to be held, in milliseconds.
---
--- Derived, never configured, for the same reason the streaming rate is: the
--- driver redraws a whole figure every frame, so its cost IS a sustained rate
--- -- `frames per second x drones x bytes per figure` -- out of the same slice
--- of the link as everything else. The configured `frameMs` is a FLOOR.
---
--- AND THE BANDWIDTH IS NOT WHAT BINDS. Measured 2026-09-20: a frame of 300 ms
--- left 0 of 8 bodies ready and stayed there for fifty frames, while 1200 ms
--- reached 8 of 8. The spawn latency binds about four times harder than the
--- byte budget ever did. This function still exists because the budget must
--- also be respected -- but the number it usually returns is the measured

--- THE HYBRID. Lights fly the movement, bodies hold the figure.

--- ignores a transform write, so it can hold a shape and never travel. A
--- looping effect has no body but CAN be moved -- the client repositions a
--- live particle graph in place, keeping the same handle and its trails,
--- rather than restarting it -- so it can travel and never convince anybody it
--- is a machine.
---
--- So the swarm changes hands twice per figure:
---
---   bodies at A  ->  lights up at A  ->  bodies down  ->  lights fly A to B
---                ->  bodies up at B  ->  lights down  ->  hold

--- leave the sky empty for however long a body takes to stream, which is the
--- 400 ms the rest of this file is about.

-- seconds. That is the whole experiment, and it settles a question the source
-- cannot: every drone record resolves to an `av_*.ent` VEHICLE template rather
-- than a humanoid puppet, so the body may hover under vehicle physics instead
-- of falling to the navmesh like a person.
--

--
--   drift stays near zero and it hangs there
--       the vehicle rig does not take the navmesh projection, and the npc

--       the answer is final. Watch the client log for

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The movement instrument
--
-- ONE drone, flown back and forth between two points, and MEASURED. It exists
-- because the static half is now proven -- a frozen drone NPC hangs exactly
-- where the server puts it, thirty metres up, for thirty seconds -- and
-- movement is the only thing between that and a show.
--
-- WHAT IT FOUND, 2026-09-20: nothing moves. 58 writes sent, 58 accepted,
-- steps up to 7.79 m, the canonical position changing on 9 reads out of 10 --
-- and four screen captures with the camera unmoved, building edges aligning
-- pixel for pixel, showing the drone on the same pixel throughout. Re-run with
-- a simulation lease and steps up to 13.79 m: the same. It is not the deadband
-- and it is not the lease; a server transform write reaches the canonical
-- record and never reaches the rendered body.
--
-- The instrument stays because one axis is still unrun -- the console path
-- shifted its arguments by one and silently ran horizontal when vertical was
-- asked for -- and because it is the thing that would notice if a future
-- build changed its mind.
--
-- WHAT IT WAS TESTING, and the prediction it tested against. A server
-- `setTransform` bumps the NPC's revision; the client compares the new
-- canonical point against where the body is and arms a placement ONLY IF THEY
-- DIFFER BY MORE THAN TWO METRES, then issues an `AI::TeleportCommand` every
-- 300 ms until the body is within two metres, twelve attempts at most. So:
--
--   commanded step under 2 m   the deadband swallows it, nothing moves
--   commanded step over 2 m    coarse teleports, 300 ms apart at best
--
-- `step at most` in the report is the number to read against that 2 m line,
-- and the defaults sweep both sides of it.
--
-- AND THE TRAP IN THE MEASUREMENT. `Open77.npcs.get` returns the CANONICAL
-- record. With no authority lease nothing simulates the body and nothing
-- reports its position back, so the canonical record is only ever what this
-- resource last wrote: the error reads as a perfect zero whatever the body is
-- really doing. Every report therefore prints the authority and labels itself
-- INERT when there is none. `mode = "tasks"` grants a lease, and is the only
-- way the number becomes an observation rather than an echo.
