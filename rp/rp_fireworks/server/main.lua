-- ONE CLOCK, ONE AUTHORITY. Every shell goes out through Open77.effects.play,
-- which broadcasts it to the players in range. So a show is the same show for
-- everybody: same shell, same world point, same moment. The tempting shortcut
-- -- tell each client "play the show" and let it run its own timers -- drifts
-- within the first volley and gives every player a different spectacle.
--
-- A CUE WITH A `ttlMs` IS NOT A ONE-SHOT. A burst plays out and vanishes; a
-- flare burns and a smoke column pours until something retires them. Fired as
-- one-shots those are still in the world after the show, which is how a
-- celebration leaves a smoking crater behind it. The looping registry owns
-- that lifetime instead (`Open77.effects.create` + `ttlMs`).
