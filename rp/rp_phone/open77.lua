-- rp_phone: the holophone of a Night City RP server.
-- Contacts, messages (delivered offline), voice calls on a private channel, city
-- services (NCPD, Trauma Team, Delamain, mechanic), location sharing and paid ads,
-- behind a 360x640 WebUI panel opened with /tel. The SERVER owns everything: the
-- page only sends intents and renders the state the server pushes back.

-- open77_notifications ships a client half, so a manifest delivered to clients may
-- depend on it; the card of Open77.notifications.send asks for the line.
dependency "open77_notifications"
dependency "open77_animations"

-- rp_inventory, rp_identity, rp_ncpd, rp_trauma, rp_delamain, rp_jobs, rp_bank and
-- rp_economy are reached through exports inside pcall and never declared: this
-- manifest ships a client script, and a client-delivered manifest cannot depend on a
-- server-only resource (rp_economy) without ending the session with missing_dependency.
