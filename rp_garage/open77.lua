-- rp_garage: owned vehicles for a Night City RP server.
-- Plates, garages, the dealership, keys, locks and the impound lot are all decided on the
-- server; the client only places the three POIs and adds ALT+click entries that send a request.

-- Every declared dependency ships a client half, so a manifest delivered to clients may

--   open77_uikit         : the garage / dealership menus and confirmations (server twins)
--   open77_worldui       : the three POIs (ring + map pin + E prompt), client side
--   open77_contextmenu   : ALT+click "Give a key" on a player, "Lock / unlock" and "Read the plate"
--                          on a vehicle (client)
--   open77_notifications : the toasts that accompany a purchase, a store and a take-out

-- clients cannot depend on them), the others are optional and degrade to a chat line.
